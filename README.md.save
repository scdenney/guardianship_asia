# Guardianship Asia

This repository contains code and outputs for the project *Guardianship Asia*, a comparative study of citizen support for non-democratic forms of governance across East and Southeast Asia. Drawing on World Values Survey data (WVS Time Series 1981–2022, RDS v5.0), the project examines mass support for various types of elite rule — including technocratic, military, and strongman leadership — and their tension with democratic ideals.

## Structure

- `scripts/`: Contains R-based Quarto (`.qmd`) files used for analysis and visualization. All scripts are designed for execution in RStudio.
- `figures/`: Output directory for plots, graphs, and visualizations used in the manuscript.
- `data/` (not included in this repository): The main dataset used is **WVS_Time_Series_1981-2022_rds_v5_0**, available from the [World Values Survey](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/).

More folders and content will be added as the project develops.
